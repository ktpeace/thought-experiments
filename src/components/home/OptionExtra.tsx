        the <span className="font-bold">spirit</span> or{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">intent</span>. You can usually come up with

        just...&quot;{" "}

      <p>
        If you think an experiment is flawed, consider the dilemma or concept it
        was invented to isolate, and try to come up with a better thought
        experiment for that instead.{" "}
