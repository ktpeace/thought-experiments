        While exploring thought experiments, it&apos;s important to keep in mind
        the <span className="font-bold">spirit</span> or{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">intent</span>. You can usually come up with
        an alternate action: "I wouldn&apos;t do either of these! I&apos;d
        just..."{" "}
      </p>
      <p>But that&apos;s missing the point.</p>
      <p>
        If you think an experiment is flawed, consider the dilemma or concept it
        was invented to isolate, and try to come up with a better thought
        experiment for that instead.{" "}
