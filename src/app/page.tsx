        <p>
          Thought experiments are hypothetical situations that isolate moral
          dilemmas or concepts for contemplation and exploration. You can
          explore and <span className="font-semibold">vote</span> on some of the
          most famous ones below. Some of these are as old as ancient Greece!
        </p>
        <p>
          While exploring thought experiments, it&apos;s important to keep in
          mind the <span className="font-semibold">spirit</span> or intention of
          the thought experiment. You can usually come up with an alternate
          action you could take: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do either of these!
          I&apos;d just...&quot; But{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            this is missing the point of the experiment
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think an experiment is flawed, consider the dilemma or concept
          it&apos;s trying to isolate, and try to come up with a better thought
          experiment for that case instead.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-lg">Happy thinking!ðŸ¥‚</p>
